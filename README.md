# 🚀 Lab: Native Array Methods pt.2

Update README.md
This lab is an opportunity to enhance your JavaScript skills through hands-on practice with array methods `forEach`, `map`, `find`, `some/every`, and `sort()`.

## Getting Started

### 1. 🍴 Clone the Repository (from Github)

- On the GitHub page of this repository, click the green "Code" button.
- Copy the URL provided under "Clone with HTTPS".
- Open your terminal and execute:
  ```
  git clone [paste the URL here]
  ```
- This command clones the repository to your local machine.

### 1a. 🍴 Clone the Repository (without Github)

1. **Clone the Repository Directly:**

   - Open your terminal on your local machine.

2. **Clone Using Terminal:**
   - Execute the following command to clone the repository (replace `[paste the URL here]` with the URL you provided):
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/CastonPursuit/Lab-Native-Array-Methods-Pt2.git
     ```
   - This command will clone the repository to your local machine.

### 2. 🔍 Explore the Problems

- In your terminal, navigate to the cloned repository's directory:
  ```
   cd Lab-Native-Array-Methods-Pt2
  ```
- Open the project in VS Code by typing:
  ```
  code .
  ```
- You will find the `index.js` file containing 20 problems, each using a different array method.

### 3. 💡 Work on the Problems

- Each problem in `index.js` focuses on practicing a specific array method.
- Read the instructions for each problem and try to solve it.
- Use `console.log()` within your solutions to output results.

### 4. 🏃 Run Your Code

- Test your solutions by running:
  ```
  node index.js
  ```
- This command executes your code in `index.js`, allowing you to see the output in the terminal.

### 5. 🧪 Test Your Solutions

- To ensure your solutions are correct, use:
  ```
  npm test
  ```
- This will run any predefined tests to validate your solutions.

### 6. 💾 Save Your Progress

- After solving each problem and verifying your solution, commit your progress:
  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m 'Completed problem # using Y method'
  ```
- Replace `#` with the problem number and `Y` with the array method used.

### 7. 🔄 Repeat

- Continue working through each problem, running your code, testing, and committing your solutions.

### 8. 🚀 Next Steps

- After completing all the problems, you're ready for the next phase of your learning journey.
- In the upcoming lesson, you'll learn how to push your solutions back to GitHub, sharing your progress and receiving feedback.

### 9. 🆘 Need Help?

- If you find yourself stuck on a problem, don't hesitate to review the [MDN Web Docs on Array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).
- Collaboration is key to learning. Feel free to discuss approaches with your peers or reach out to a coach for guidance.
